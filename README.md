## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```
<script defer src="src/k7.min.js?v=7"></script>
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

```
<h1>photos</h1>
<div class="images-container images">
  <img src="photos/photo01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="photo01">
  <img src="photos/photo02.webp" loading="lazy" alt="photo02">
  <img src="photos/photo03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="photo03">
</div>
```

## üîß Configuration

Custom Image Extensions and Other Configuration

To override the default extension, add a data-ext attribute to the tag:
```
<img src="photos/photo16.webp" loading="lazy" alt="photo16" data-ext="webp">
````
This replaces the default .jpg extension with .webp for higher-resolution loading. If the data-ext attribute is set, it overrides the default extension. If not, the extensions should match (e.g., .jpg remains .jpg). For optimization, the index.dataset.ext check can be removed if unnecessary, as a micro-optimization. Note: This does not apply to .svg files.

Configurations can be found in the code ([// user config]

CSS background colors, update the CSS variables like so:
```
:root { --color1: #ee7; --color2: #777; }
```
CSS is encoded in Base64, which typically increases the file size. However, the CSS file is still included and can be separated from the JavaScript.

Note: There's no need to include a separate stylesheet; all styles are managed directly in JavaScript.
