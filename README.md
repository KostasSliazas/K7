## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Include the gallery in your HTML:
Link the necessary JS file in your HTML. Add this script to the <head> of your HTML:

```
<script defer src="src/k7.min.js?v=7"></script>
```

## üîß Configuration

Custom Image Extensions and Other Configuration

To override the default extension, add a data-ext attribute to the <img> tag:

```
<img src="photos/photo16.webp" loading="lazy" alt="photo16" data-ext="webp">
```

This replaces the default .jpg extension with .webp for higher-resolution loading. If the data-ext attribute is set, it overrides the default extension. If not, the extensions should match (e.g., .jpg remains .jpg). For optimization, the index.dataset.ext check can be removed if unnecessary, as a micro-optimization. Note: This does not apply to .svg files.

Configurations can be found in the code ([// user config]

CSS background colors, update the CSS variables like so:

:root {
  --color1: #ee7;
  --color2: #777;
}

CSS is encoded in Base64, which typically increases the file size. However, the CSS file is still included and can be separated from the JavaScript.

Note: There's no need to include a separate stylesheet; all styles are managed directly in JavaScript.

## üî® Build

```
This gallery is compiled using Google Closure Compiler:

google-closure-compiler -O ADVANCED k7.js --js_output_file k7.min.js

Without recompiling, just need to change (a.dataset.ext || "jpg") to set a default extension, for example, (a.dataset.ext || "webp"), and "large/" for greater resolutions, for example, "larger-" as a prefix or "hd1080/" as a folder. There is another version available‚Äîif you have issues with fullscreen in "Project -Kitten", you can use the version with height: 100dvh compiled in css.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KostasSliazas/project-kitten/refs/heads/main/js/gall7.min.v7.js
