## Custom Image Extensions and Other Configuration

To override the default extension, add a `data-ext` attribute to the `<img>` tag:
```html
<img src="photos/photo16.webp" loading="lazy" alt="photo16" data-ext="webp">
```
This replaces the default `.jpg` extension with `.webp` for higher-resolution loading. If the `data-ext` attribute is set, it overrides the default extension. If not, the extensions should match (e.g., `.jpg` remains `.jpg`). For optimization, the `index.dataset.ext` check can be removed if unnecessary, as a micro-optimization. Note: This does not apply to `.svg` files.

Configurations can be found in the code between lines **25** and **34** (`[// user config]`).

To adjust image proportions, you can add the following CSS rule:
```css
#k7 img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

To modify background colors, update the CSS variables like so:
```css
:root {
  --color1: #ee7;
  --color2: #777;
}
```
